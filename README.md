# Isometric Exercise Timer
## Summary
This is a simple CLI script created with kegels and other isometric training in mind. It is a timer that was inspired by an old piece of beerware called xercise.exe, the source of which I can't seem to find. While this script lacks a "mixed" mode, it allows for much more customizability than its spiritual predecessor.
