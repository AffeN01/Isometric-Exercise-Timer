# Kegel Exercises
Here's a simple CLI script for doing kegels and other isometric exercises, written in Python. It was inspired by an old piece of beerware called xercise.exe, the source of which I can't seem to find. While this script lacks a "mixed" mode, it allows for much more customizability than its spiritual predecessor.
